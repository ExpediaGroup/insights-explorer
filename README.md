### Building the Project

This repository is a monorepo with multiple projects inside it. [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is currently used to manage the monorepo.

ðŸš¨ The Node.js version is managed by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Install with `brew install nvm` or follow the installation instructions.

```sh
nvm use
npm install && npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

### Running Locally

Running IEX locally is convenient for development.

Environment variables need to be provided by creating an `.env.development.local` file under `packages/backend/env`.  The `.env` file can be used as a template:

```sh
cp packages/backend/env/.env packages/backend/env/.env.development.local
```

Please note that any `.env.*.local` files will be ignored by git, so it is safe to embed secrets in those files for local use only.

Start the frontend/backend servers:

```sh
npm start
```

The `backend` service starts on port 3000, and `frontend` launches on port 3001.  Please note that this is only to facilitate development&mdash; in production the backend service serves the compiled frontend files.

### Docker

This project also provides a Dockerfile. Building a Docker image only requires Docker to be installed.

You can build and run the main Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t insights-explorer:latest .
docker run -p 3001:3001 insights-explorer:latest
```

Convertbot:

```sh
ln -s -f packages/convertbot/.dockerignore ./.dockerignore
docker build -t iex/convertbot:latest -f packages/convertbot/Dockerfile .
```

Slackbot:

```sh
ln -s -f packages/slackbot/.dockerignore ./.dockerignore
docker build -t iex/slackbot:latest -f packages/slackbot/Dockerfile .
```
