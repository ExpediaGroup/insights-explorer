Insights Explorer is a website designed to make it easy to document, edit, and view analytical insights.  Insights are Markdown-based repositories stored in GitHub, but viewed and edited through our interface.  IEX has support for full-text searching, advanced Markdown syntax, and document viewing (e.g. `pptx`, `docx`, `pdf`, etc.).

# Features

* Create and edit Markdown-based documents
* File upload & viewing for common file types
* Discover Insights with full-text search
* Like and comment to contribute to the discussion

# Installation

Insights Explorer requires the following dependencies:

* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)  7.x
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 10+
* AWS S3 bucket (or compatible API)
* AWS SQS queues
* [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) application for authentication
* GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise account & organization

## Local Development

For contributing features and fixes, IEX can be compiled and run locally.

### Building the Project

This repository is a monorepo with multiple projects inside it. [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is currently used to manage the monorepo.

ðŸš¨ The Node.js version is managed by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Install with `brew install nvm` or follow the installation instructions.

```sh
nvm use
npm install && npm run bootstrap
npm run build
```

### Running a Development Server

Environment variables need to be provided by creating an `.env.development.local` file under `packages/backend/env`.  The `.env` file can be used as a template:

```sh
cp packages/backend/env/.env packages/backend/env/.env.development.local
```

Please note that any `.env.*.local` files will be ignored by git, so it is safe to embed secrets in those files for local use only.

Start the frontend/backend servers:

```sh
npm start
```

The `backend` service starts on port 3000, and `frontend` launches on port 3001.  Please note that this is only to facilitate development&mdash; in production the backend service serves the compiled frontend files.

## Self-Hosted Production

### Docker

Pre-built Docker images are available in the GitHub container registery:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/expediagroup/insights-explorer:1
```

Create a new `.env` file containing all the required configuration, then run the image:

```sh
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file=.env ghcr.io/expediagroup/insights-explorer:1
```

### Manually Building Docker Images

Building the Docker images manually only requires Docker to be installed.

You can build and run the main Docker image:

```sh
docker build -t insights-explorer:latest .
docker run -p 3001:3001 insights-explorer:latest
```

Convertbot:

```sh
docker build -t iex/convertbot:latest -f packages/convertbot/Dockerfile .
```

Slackbot:

```sh
docker build -t iex/slackbot:latest -f packages/slackbot/Dockerfile .
```
