Insights Explorer is a website designed to make it easy to document, edit, and view analytical insights.  Insights are Markdown-based repositories stored in GitHub, but viewed and edited through our interface.  IEX has support for full-text searching, advanced Markdown syntax, and document viewing (e.g. `pptx`, `docx`, `pdf`, etc.).

# Features

* Create and edit Markdown-based documents
* File upload & viewing for common file types
* Discover Insights with full-text search
* Like and comment to contribute to the discussion

# Installation

Insights Explorer requires the following dependencies:

* [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/elasticsearch/)  7.x
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) 10+
* AWS S3 bucket (or compatible API)
* AWS SQS queues
* OAuth provider (Support for [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-oauth-apps) or [Okta](https://www.okta.com/) included)
* GitHub.com or GitHub Enterprise account & organization

## Local Development

For contributing features and fixes, IEX can be built and run locally.

### Building the Project

This repository is a monorepo using [npm workspaces](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v8/using-npm/workspaces) to manage the contained packages.

ðŸš¨ The Node.js version is managed by [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). Install with `brew install nvm` or follow the installation instructions.

```sh
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
```

### Running a Development Server

Environment variables need to be provided by creating an `.env.development.local` file under `packages/backend/env`.  The `.env` file can be used as a template:

```sh
cp packages/backend/env/.env packages/backend/env/.env.development.local
```

Please note that any `.env.*.local` files will be ignored by git, so it is safe to embed secrets in those files for local use only.

Start the frontend/backend servers:

```sh
npm start
```

The `backend` service starts on port 3000, and `frontend` launches on port 3001.  Please note that this is only to facilitate development&mdash; in production the backend service serves the compiled frontend files.

## Self-Hosted Production

### Docker

Pre-built Docker images are available in the GitHub container registery:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/expediagroup/insights-explorer:1
```

Create a new `.env` file containing all the required configuration, then run the image:

```sh
docker run -p 3001:3001 --env-file=.env ghcr.io/expediagroup/insights-explorer:1
```

### Docker Compose

A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided to make it easy to spin up a local instance of Insights Explorer.  It includes PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch, and Minio.  It is pre-configured with all required environment variables to make it as easy to launch as possible.

Please note that it is intended for development and testing ONLY and is not suitable for a production deployment!

ðŸŽ¯ **Note**: Several environment variables must be manually-provided in the `docker-compose.yml` before it can be launched; specifically the GitHub-related variables.  Please refer to the [wiki] for more details.

Launch all services with the `all` profile:

```sh
docker compose --profile all up
```

Once the services have started, you can access the following URLs:

- Insights Explorer: http://localhost:3001
- Kibana: http://localhost:5601
- Minio Console: http://localhost:9001 (user `minio` / password `minio123`)

For more information about `docker compose`, refer to the [wiki].

```sh
docker build -t insights-explorer:latest .

```sh
docker build -t iex/convertbot:latest -f packages/convertbot/Dockerfile .
