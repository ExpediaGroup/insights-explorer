# Examples

This package contains example Insights, several of which were [generated using machine learning][lorem-insight].  These Insights are for demonstration purposes only, and do not contain any coherent information.

## Usage

IEX will automatically sync these Insights on startup if the environment variable `EXAMPLES_INIT_ON_STARTUP` is set to `true`.  This is not recommended for production systems as it may delay startup.
