# Insights Explorer Convertbot

Standalone service that facilitates conversion of documents between different file types. It is built on a Node.js Debian base image with pre-installed packages for converting various document types.

This is not a minimialist image!  Rather than focus on size, it aims to provide a comprehensive foundation for document conversions.

The latest version includes both [Unoconv](https://github.com/unoconv/unoconv) (for Office documents) and [nbconvert](https://nbconvert.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (for Jupyter notebooks).
